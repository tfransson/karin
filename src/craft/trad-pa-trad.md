##### Brief
Make a storage unit out of wire, mounted on the wall with maximum three screws.

##### Wire
The sketch process was material based, to explore the wire and the possibilities within it. 

##### A meeting between hard and soft
There is a relationship between the link and the knitting stitch. Both are traditional techniques that go
way back in history. Both are based on time-consuming, repetitive work. Both are made of thread/wire.
By picking up textiles and shaping metal, I have investigated the meeting between these two materials. Within the confines of the home, I have sought an interplay between the hard and the soft.
A design that revolves around materials, time and value.
